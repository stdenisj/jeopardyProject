Overview
I chose to create Automotive Jeopardy as my first project.<br>
My goal for this project was to prioritize JavaScript functions and use over HTML and CSS.

How it works

There is a start and reset button.<br>
When pressed the start button will create the game board.<br>
The player then chooses a category and point value.<br>
Based on the user's selection a question and three multiple choice answers appear.<br>
If the user guesses the correct answer the point value will be added to their score.<br>
If the user does not guess the correct answer, then those points will be deducted from their score.<br>
The game ends when all questions are answered. They will win if their score is over 2000.<br>
